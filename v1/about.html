<!--Module 1 (the LO #s match those in the original module objective list):
M1LO10 Demonstrate the use of special characters from extended character sets (HTML, use entities, not cut-and-pasted unicode characters)

M1LO13 Demonstrate using 3 types of hyperlinks: site navigation, targeted location using ids, and external (HTML, this item should be specified 3 times, once on each type of link)

Module 2 (the LO #s match those in the original module objective list):

I have noted how to provide the explanations in your code for the non-(3) items:

M2LO3 Demonstrate style precedence and inheritance in CSS (CSS, this item should be specified 2 times, once where precedence is applied and once where inheritance is applied; see 2-3d Style Specificity and Precedence, and 2-3e Style Inheritance)
M2LO4 Demonstrate external, embedded, and inline styles (HTML, this item should be specified 2 times, once each for embedded and inline styles; note external was taken care of with M1LO8; see 2-3b Embedded Style Sheets, and 2-3c Inline Styles)
M2LO5 Demonstrate contextual selectors (CSS, specify 2 times, showing two different types of contextual selectors as shown in Figure 2-12, Contextual Selectors, of the textbook)
M2LO6  Demonstrate a CSS id and a CSS class selector (CSS, specify 2 times, show a use of id and a use of class, see 2-9b Attribute selectors)
M2LO7 Demonstrate a CSS attribute selector other than class or id (CSS, specify 1 time, see 2-9b Attribute selectors)
M2LO11 Demonstrate a pseudo-classes and a pseudo-element selector (CSS, specify 2 times, show one pseudo-class and one pseudo-element, see 2-18 Using Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements)
M2LO12 Demonstrate how CSS can change presentation of page elements (CSS, these are styles that impact page elements rather than impacting text on the page)
M2LO13 Demonstrate how CSS can change presentation of textual elements (CSS, these are styles that impact text that is rendered on the page)
M2LO14 Demonstrate and explain the use of progressive enhancement in CSS (CSS, see 2-6 Employing Progressive Enhancement)
M2LO15 Apply colors using CSS (CSS, see 2-5 Working with Color in CSS)-->
